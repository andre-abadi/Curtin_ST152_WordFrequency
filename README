A Java program that operates on the command line.

It is able to scan a given directory for .txt files, 
and scan all of the words in all files. Words are 
assumed to be character sequences separated by spaces.
When read, the words are inserted into a Binary Tree, 
which stores their count and name in alphabetic order.
A recursive, in-order tree traversal is used to pull 
the data from the Binary Tree and to store as an array.
To display the data or write it to file, the Merge 
Sort recursive sorting algorithm is used to recurse 
over the array of words and their counts.

Words are sorted in ascending order of count, with 
words of the same count being sorted alphabetically. The 
program is able to output to the terminal in ascending 
and descending order of count. In descending order, 
words of the same count are listed in reverse-alphabetic 
order. Sorted word counts are also able to be written 
as Comma Separated values (CSV) to a nominated file.

This program was written to the specification provided 
by the Assignment 1 parameters, in the Software 
Technology 152 unit, Semester 1 2011, at Curtin 
University, Western Australia.
